    "biography": "Angelina Jolie is an American actress. She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards. Jolie has promoted humanitarian causes throughout the world, and is noted for her work with refugees as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). She has been cited as one of the world's most beautiful women and her off-screen life is widely reported.\n\nThough she made her screen debut as a child alongside her father Jon Voight in the 1982 film Lookin' to Get Out, Jolie's acting career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993). Her first leading role in a major film was in Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie achieved wider fame after her portrayal of video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), and since then has established herself as one of the best-known and highest-paid actresses in Hollywood. She has had her biggest commercial successes with the action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) and the animated film Kung Fu Panda (2008).\n\nDivorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, Jolie currently lives with actor Brad Pitt, in a relationship that has attracted worldwide media attention. Jolie and Pitt have three adopted children, Maddox, Pax, and Zahara, as well as three biological children, Shiloh, Knox, and Vivienne.",

The program originates from NBC Studios in Burbank, California, and is broadcast Monday through Friday at 11:35 PM in the Eastern and Pacific time zones. Unlike Carson or his predecessor Jack Paar, Leno only once utilized a guest host, preferring to host the series by himself.\n\nOn April 26, 1999, the show began broadcasting in 1080i HDTV, becoming the first American nightly talk show to be shot in high definition. The show is shot in 16:9 aspect ratio.\n\nThe series, which followed the same basic format as that of his predecessors, ran until May 29, 2009, after which Leno was succeeded by Conan O'Brien. NBC signed Leno to a new deal for a nightly talk show in the 10:00 pm ET timeslot.

The program aired live from 7 to 9 a.m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday in the Eastern time zone; most affiliates in the Central, Mountain, and Pacific time zones aired the show on tape-delay from 7 to 9 a.m. local time. The Saturday edition aired live from 7 to 9 a.m. Eastern Time as well, but a number of affiliates did not carry it or aired it later on tape-delay. It premiered on November 1, 1999, and was the newest of the major networks' morning shows, although CBS has made several attempts to program in the morning slot since 1954. The show aired as a division of CBS News.\n\nThe Early Show, like many of its predecessors, traditionally ran last in the ratings to its rivals, NBC's Today and ABC's Good Morning America. Much like NBC's The Today Show and The Tonight Show, the title The Early Show was analogous to that of CBS's late-night talk show, The Late Show.\n\nOn November 15, 2011, CBS announced that a new morning show would replace The Early Show on January 9, 2012. CBS News chairman Jeff Fager and CBS News president David Rhodes stated that the new show would \"redefine the morning television landscape.\" On December 1, it was announced that the new show would be titled CBS This Morning. The Early Show ended its twelve-year run on January 6, 2012, to make way for the program. Charlie Rose, Gayle King, and Erica Hill were named anchors of the new program.",

The show is shot in 16:9 aspect ratio.\n\nThe series, which followed the same basic format as that of his predecessors, ran until May 29, 2009, after which Leno was succeeded by Conan O'Brien. NBC signed Leno to a new deal for a nightly talk show in the 10:00 pm ET timeslot.

The program aired live from 7 to 9 a.m. Eastern Time Monday through Friday in the Eastern time zone; most affiliates in the Central, Mountain, and Pacific time zones aired the show on tape-delay from 7 to 9 a.m. local time. The Saturday edition aired live from 7 to 9 a.m. Eastern Time as well, but a number of affiliates did not carry it or aired it later on tape-delay. It premiered on November 1, 1999, and was the newest of the major networks' morning shows, although CBS has made several attempts to program in the morning slot since 1954. The show aired as a division of CBS News.\n\nThe Early Show, like many of its predecessors, traditionally ran last in the ratings to its rivals, NBC's Today and ABC's Good Morning America. Much like NBC's The Today Show and The Tonight Show, the title The Early Show was analogous to that of CBS's late-night talk show, The Late Show.\n\nOn November 15, 2011, CBS announced that a new morning show would replace The Early Show on January 9, 2012. CBS News chairman Jeff Fager and CBS News president David Rhodes stated that the new show would \"redefine the morning television landscape.\" On December 1, it was announced that the new show would be titled CBS This Morning. The Early Show ended its twelve-year run on January 6, 2012, to make way for the program. Charlie Rose, Gayle King, and Erica Hill were named anchors of the new program.",

She has been cited as one of the world's most beautiful women and her off-screen life is widely reported.\n\nThough she made her screen debut as a child alongside her father Jon Voight in the 1982 film Lookin' to Get Out, Jolie's acting career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993). Her first leading role in a major film was in Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie achieved wider fame after her portrayal of video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), and since then has established herself as one of the best-known and highest-paid actresses in Hollywood. She has had her biggest commercial successes with the action-comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) and the animated film Kung Fu Panda (2008).\n\nDivorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, Jolie currently lives with actor Brad Pitt, in a relationship that has attracted worldwide media attention.

V 16-tich rokoch sa dostala k práci ako modelka v Londýne, Los Angeles a New Yorku. Angelina dokazovala, že nepotrebuje meno slávneho otca, aby sa presadila. Nastáva komerčné obdobie jej života, čo potvrdzuje aj ponuka od režiséra Simon Westa na sfilmovanie akčnej postavy Lary Croft z počítačovej hry Tomb Rider.\n\nHra bola hitom po celom svete a hlavne preto mala filmová verzia veľký potenciál. Lara Croft: Tomb Rider z roku 2001 sa stal úspešný film, ktorý pri rozpočte 80 mil. dolárov zarobil len v amerických kinách 130 mil. dolárov. Pokračovanie na seba nedalo dlho čakať a do kín v roku 2003 prišla Lara Croft-Tomb Rider: The Cradle of Life (kolíska života). Druhý diel nebol taký úspešný ako prvý, najmä u kritikov.\n\nRok 2004, je rok od rozvodu z Billym Bobom Thortonom. Jediné, čo Angie po ňom zostalo bolo nahlodané sebavedomie a tetovanie. Začína sa stále viac zaujímať o humanitárne práce. Adoptovala si kambodžského chlapca menom Maddox a aj to bol možno dôvod rozvodu s Billym.\n\nNeprejde ani chvíľa od posledného filmu a Angelina sa púšťa do zaujímavej postavy, kde stvárni matku macedónskeho dobyvateľa Alexandra Veľkého v podaní Colina Farrella. Ani veľkolepá výprava, fantastický režisér, výborní herci nezabránili prepadnutiu filmu tak u kritikov ako ja u divákov. Ďalšou historickou drámou je Love and Honor, v ktorej stvárnila cárovnú Katarínu Veľkú.\n\nČasopis People ju zaradil medzi 50 najkrajších ľudí sveta, kráľ Kambodže jej udelil národné občianstvo a nazývajú ju veľvyslankyňa dobrej vôle UNHCR. Je rada, že si to ľudia o nej myslia. Film Beyond Borders bol takou malou kampaňou na pomoc krajinám tretieho sveta. Medzi jej posledné úlohy patrí postava manželky zavraždeného novinára Daniela Pearla vo filme A Mighty Heart. Angelina vstupuje do digitálneho veku.\n\nV súčasnosti žije s hercom Bradom Pittom, s ktorým má tri biologické deti: Shiloh, Knox a Vivienne. Spolu adoptovali deti Maddoxa, Zaharu a Paxa. Angelina Jolie sa angažuje v humanitárnych projektoch na celom svete, hlavne týkajúcich sa problematiky utečencov v rámci UNHCR.\n\n13. júna 2014 jej anglická kráľovná Alžbeta II. udelila čestný rad Dame za prácu v boji proti sexuálnemu násiliu vo vojnových zónach."

Eddigi legnagyobb díjai közé tartozik az Oscar-díj, a két Screen Actors Guild Awards-díj, és három Golden Globe-díj, így nem véletlenül vált Hollywood egyik legjobban fizetett színésznőjévé. Először csak videóklipekben szerepelt, majd filmes karrierbe kezdett a George Wallace című filmmel (1997), amiért Golden Globe és Emmy-díjra is jelölték.\n\nEzt követően olyan filmekben játszott, mint az Észvesztő (2000) és a Vakrepülés (1999), amiért újabb Golden Globe díjat kapott. Ekkor házasodott össze Billy Bob Thortonnal.\n\nAz igazi áttörést azonban egy videojáték-adaptáció, a Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) című film hozta meg számára, mely ugyan nem aratott sikert szakmai körökben, a mozipénztáraknál kimondottan jól szerepelt. A kambodzsai forgatás során vált elkötelezetté a humanitárius ügyek iránt, később így lett az ENSZ nagykövete. Jelenlegi férjével, Brad Pitt-tel való kapcsolata állítólag a Mr. és Mrs. Smith (2005) című kémfilm forgatásán kezdődött, Pitt mindenesetre még abban az évben elvált korábbi feleségétől, Jennifer Anistontól.\n\nJolie rendezőként is bizonyított, először 2011-ben a bosnyák-szerb háborút feldolgozó A vér és méz földje című filmmel.\n\nLegutóbb a filmvásznon a Demóna (2014) című Disney-szuperprodukcióban láthattuk.

Przed kamerami zadebiutowała w wieku 5 lat u boku swojego ojca w filmie \"Szukając wyjścia\". Kiedy skończyła 11 lat, rozpoczęła naukę w elitarnej szkole Lee Strasberg Theater Institute, gdzie uczyła się podstaw pracy aktora. W wieku 16 lat Jolie została zatrudniona jako modelka i w krótkim czasie jej twarz zaczęła być znana. Dzięki swojej urodzie często była angażowana do występów w wideoklipach, m.in. takich sław jak Meat Loaf, Lenny Kravitz czy The Rolling Stones. Z czasem jednak okazało się, że granie to jedyna dziedzina sztuki, która naprawdę pasjonuje Angelinę. Wstąpiła do trupy aktorskiej Met Theatre Group, gdzie u boku Eda Harrisa i Holly Hunter doskonaliła swój warsztat. Swoją pierwszą poważną rolę Jolie zagrała w roku 1993 w obrazie \"Cyborg 2: Szklany cień\". Niestety przeszła ona bez echa. Pierwsze dobre recenzje Angelina dostała dopiero w 1995 po premierze filmu \"Hakerzy\". Obraz okazał się niewypałem, ale krytycy zgodnie stwierdzili, że kreacja, którą stworzyła Jolie, zasługuje na uznanie. Mimo pochlebnych opinii na swoją wielką szansę aktorka musiała poczekać jeszcze dwa lata. W 1997 roku wystąpiła u boku Gary'ego Sinise'a w telewizyjnym obrazie \"George Wallace\". Za rolę Cornelii Angelina otrzymała Złoty Glob, a jej nazwisko stało się znane w filmowym światku. Dwa lata później Jolie zdobyła kolejny Złoty Glob, tym razem już dla najlepszej aktorki pierwszego planu, za kreację, którą stworzyła w obrazie \"Gia\". Swoją pozycję gwiazdy Jolie ugruntowała, zdobywając Oscara za rolę w filmie \"Przerwana lekcja muzyki\". W kolejnych latach aktorka wystąpiła m.in. w \"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\", \"Oszukanej\", \"Salt\" czy \"Czarownicy\". Angelina Jolie dała się poznać także jako reżyserka, takimi obrazami jak \"Niezłomny\" czy \"Nad morzem\", w którym zagrała również główną rolę żeńską u boku swego ówczesnego męża Brada Pitta. Para była małżeństwem w latach 2014-2019 i doczekała się trójki biologicznych oraz trójki adoptowanych dzieci."
